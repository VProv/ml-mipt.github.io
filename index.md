We ask you:
- don't flood: chat contains lots of people - respect their time and attention.
    This especially regards tutors because we try to carefully read and respond to every message.
- don't spoil homeworks' solutions. Discuss common approaches or specific topics.
- don't use foul language (including stickers), don't be rude. Respect each other, be constructive.
- try not to write direct messages to tutors because you are numerous but we are not. If you want to call particular person or draw attention use `@mention`
